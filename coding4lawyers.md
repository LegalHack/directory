## Summary
Through this first iteration of the course, we are learning how to code from the content at [automatetheboringstuff.com](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) and the corresponding set of instructional videos from [Udemy](http://udemy.com/automate/). Automate the Boring Stuff is a free resource, written by Al Sweigart. The videos from Udemy are written and produced by Al Sweigart, have a list price of $50, and can be found for $25 [here](http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2015/09/21/automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python-online-course-now-available/), after navigating through [automatetheboringstuff.com](https://automatetheboringstuff.com). 

Following an introductory session, our group has been meeting weekly to 1) discuss challenges or ideas that were inspired by the week's content and 2) talk about the legal tech tools that course participants have found most helpful in their practices. We roughly cover two sections of video per week. After we finish running through the content, we will spend 4 weeks or so working on individual projects and will meet back together to do a demo day where we can get feedback on the work we have done. One of the goals is to create a suite of tools that attorneys can fork, edit, and adopt for use in their local practices.

The make-up of our group has included 3-4 attorneys who are completely unfamiliar with code, 3-4 attorneys who are somewhat familiar with code, and one software developer who has been able to help the less inclined navigate the *new* landscape of writing code.
